This file is intended to be included, such as in postman/base_folder.html:
    {% include "postman/inc_subject_ex.html" %}

It provides an extended subject, as a replacement to a simple {{ message.subject }} tag.
Enhancements are:
* limit the subject length to a few words
* if there is still room up to a maximum number of words, then add the very first words of the body,
  in a grey style.

Examples:
With a total of at most 12 words, and 5 words of subject.
With body: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod."

With subject: "a subject of great interest for you":
"a subject of great interest ... - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur ..."

With subject: "a great interest":
"a great interest - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed ..."
