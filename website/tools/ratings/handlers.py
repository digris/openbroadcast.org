class RatingHandler(object):
    """
    Encapsulates content rating options for a given model.
    
    This class can be subclassed to specify different behaviour and options
    for ratings of a given model, but can also be used directly, just to
    handle default rating for any model. 
    
    The default rating provides only one 1-5 ranged (without decimal places) 
    score for each content object, and allows voting only for authenticated
    users.
    
    The default rating handler uses the project's settings as options: this 
    way you can register not customized rating handlers and then modify
    their options just editing the settings file.
    
    Most common rating needs can be handled by subclassing *RatingHandler* 
    and changing the values of pre-defined attributes. 
    The full range of built-in options is as follows.
    
    
    .. py:attribute:: allow_anonymous 
    
        set to False to allow votes only by authenticated users 
        (default: *False*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: score_range 
        
        a sequence *(min_score, max_score) representing the allowed score range 
        (including extremes) 
        note that the score *0* is reserved for vote deletion
        (default: *(1, 5)*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: score_step
        
        the step allowed in scores (default: *1*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: weight 
        
        this is used while calculating the average score and represents 
        the difficulty for a target object to obtain a higher rating
        (default: *0*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: default_key
        
        default key to use for votes when there is only one vote-per-content 
        (default: *'main'*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: can_delete_vote
    
        set to False if you do not want to allow users to delete a 
        previously saved vote (default: *True*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: can_change_vote 
    
        set to False if you do not want to allow users to change the score of 
        a previously saved vote (default: *True*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: next_querystring_key
    
        querystring key that can contain the url of the redirection performed 
        after voting (default: *'next'*)
    
    .. py:attribute:: votes_per_ip_address 
    
        the number of allowed votes per ip address, only used if anonymous users 
        can vote (default: *0*, means no limit)
    
    .. py:attribute:: form_class
    
        form class that will be used to handle voting 
        (default: *ratings.forms.VoteForm*) 
        this app, out of the box, provides also *SliderVoteForm* and a *StarVoteForm*
        
    .. py:attribute:: cookie_max_age
    
        if anonymous rating is allowed, you can define here the cookie max age
        as a number of seconds (default: one year)
        
    .. py:attribute:: success_messages
    
        this should be a sequence of (vote created, vote changed, vote deleted)
        messages sent (using *django.contrib.messages*) to the 
        user after a successful vote creation, change, deletion 
        (scored without using AJAX)
        if this is None, then no message is sent (default: *None*)
    
        
    For situations where the built-in options listed above are not sufficient, 
    subclasses of *RatingHandler* can also override the methods which 
    actually perform the voting process, and apply any logic they desire.
    
    See the method's docstrings for a description of how each method is
    used during the voting process.
