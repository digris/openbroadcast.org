    <h2 id="en_3">3 User Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>All users commit themselves to use Open Broadcast within the limits of their own legal system and the Swiss legal system, 
    as well as within the framework of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <p>The Users commit themselves not to misuse Open Broadcast, in particular they agree:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To adhere to the guidelines of the Editorial Policy , which is an integral part of these Terms and Conditions, 
        and to the guidelines of the Swiss Press Council (<a href="http://www.presserat.ch/">Presserats</a>). They commit 
        themselves particularly not to disseminate any defamatory, indecent or in any other way unlawful material or information, 
        especially content of a pornographic or racist nature, or content that incites the people, or similar material that 
        infringes upon applicable law and is contrary to morality.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Not to use Open Broadcast to harass or threaten other Users, or to impinge upon the rights of third parties, 
        in particular by invading personal privacy.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Not to enter data into the system that contains computer viruses (infected software) or material that is copyrighted, 
        unless the User has the rights to it or the required consent for it.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Not to use Open Broadcast in a way that has a negative impact on the availability of the Platform for other Users.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Not to intercept emails or other messages for other Users, and not to attempt to do so. To send emails and similar

        members.&nbsp; 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Open Broadcast is not a commercial enterprise. Users commit themselves not to send chain mails, not to offer lotteries 
    or competitions similar to lotteries or run pyramid sales and / or multilevel marketing systems.</p>

    <p>Users are obliged to treat emails and other messages confidentially, and only forward them to third parties with the 
    explicit prior consent by the sender. This also applies to names, telephone and fax numbers, postal addresses, email addresses 
    and / or URLs.</p>

    <p>Users commit themselves to exempt the Licensee from any liability and from any obligations, charges and claims resulting 
    from damages due to libel, defamation, impingement of personal rights, the cancellation of services for other Users, the 
    infringement of intangible assets or any other rights. For this purpose they authorize the Licensee to pass on personal 
    information to third parties. This indemnification also refers to the costs incurred by rejecting such claims.</p>


    <h2 id="en_4">4 Data Protection Policy</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Personal information by Users and how we use it</h3>

    <p>When Users use Open Broadcast, they give the Licensee three types of information: information they give when registering, 
    information they deliberately publish &ndash; when producing content on Open Broadcast &ndash;, and information that is 
    generated technically by the interaction with Open Broadcast (together this makes up your &quot;personal information&quot;).</p>

    <p>The Licensee treats the personal information by Users particularly carefully and in compliance with Swiss and European 
    Data Protection laws, as well as Swiss Telecommunications laws.</p>

    <p>For Open Broadcast to function according to the purpose of the Licensee, i.e. media operations, the use of information, 
    such as in particular the personal information mentioned, is necessary.</p>

    <p>By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users agree that the Licensee may undertake any action with this personal information 
    (namely saving, copying and distributing) that is required to fulfil its purpose, i.e. media operations.</p>

    <p>Users further declare that their personal information may be made accessible to other Users, especially Authors and Editors, 
    and that the Licensee may use account information such as name and email address in order to communicate with them.</p>

    <p>By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users explicitly agree to the fact that personal information is available worldwide 
    via the internet and is thus passed on to other countries.</p>

    <p>By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users agree to indemnify the Licensee in the case of an infringement of third party 
    rights (see Copyright). To this purpose they authorize the Licensee to pass on personal information (relevant to the context) 
    about the infringing User to third parties, namely to the person infringed upon or to the authorities.</p>

    <p>More detailed information on how personal data is used can be found in the 
    <a href="http://www.openbroadcast.org/about/data-use-policy/">data use policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Data Protection / Disclaimer</h3>

    <p>Data Protection is important to the Licensee. It therefore takes organizational and technical 
    <a href="http://www.openbroadcast.org/about/privacy-policy/">measures</a> for the protection of Users' personal information.
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Authors and Editors are, in particular, able to limit access to their information by other Authors and Editors by means 
    of so called privacy settings. They can mark information in their account as &quot;private&quot; or not accessible to anyone, 
    or they can make information accessible only to &quot;logged-in&quot; other Authors and Editors.</p>

    <p>Users' personal information is processed on a server protected by a firewall.</p>

    <p>By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users acknowledge that the Licensee cannot control the actions of other Authors 
    and Editors they are in contact and share personal information with. Therefore the Licensee cannot guarantee that information 
    published on Open Broadcast is not seen by unauthorized persons. It particularly shall not be liable for the misuse of personal 
    information that Users have made accessible to other Authors or Editors.</p>

    <p>Users understand and acknowledge that – even if personal information has been removed from Open Broadcast – copies of 
    personal information can remain accessible on cached and archived pages, or if other Users have copied or saved the 
    information.</p>

    <p>The Licensee shall not be liable for the circumvention of privacy settings or security measures. It shall not be liable 
    in any way for damages arising from the usage of an account by persons other than the person named when registering.</p>

    <p>Any unlawful collection or misuse of personal information on Open Broadcast is an infringement of our Terms and Conditions, 
    and must be reported to the Licensee at <a href="mailto:info@openbroadcast.org">info@openbroadcast.org</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="en_5">5 Content / Copyright</h2>

    <p>The Licensee is committed to the promotion of the arts and sciences and it therefore values a free flow of information. 
    At the same time, the Licensee is committed to copyright, as this objective shall not be achieved at the cost of authors, 
    i.e. originators of works.</p>

    <p>Open Broadcast is a radio channel for the arts, sciences, politics and economics, as well as experimental and cutting-edge 
    content. It is a pilot project aimed at generating experiential data on setting up and maintaining an Open Broadcast Platform 
    with the greatest possible creative freedom. Open Broadcast is the first entirely &quot;user-generated&quot; radio station 
    in Switzerland. Not only the content, but also the processes are user-generated. Content in that sense means licensed, 
    copyrighted works, i.e. music, text, files, pictures, photographs, videos or other materials. The Open Broadcast Platform 
    offers online tools that can be used to plan, produce and stream radio shows. The commercial-free station is broadcasting 
    via webstream. The licensee is non-profit oriented and has a charitable character.</p>

    <h2 id="en_6">6 Liability of the Licensee / Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>The Licensee rejects all liability for financial, physical or immaterial damages arising from using Open Broadcast.</p>

    <p>Open Broadcast contains links to other websites and integrates content by third parties directly in Open Broadcast. 
    The use of external content is subject to the terms and conditions of the respective provider. The Licensee is not liable 
    for making external content accessible and for possible resulting damage.</p>

    <p>The information published on Open Broadcast can change at any time. The Licensee is not liable for the correctness of 
    information.</p>

    <p>In no case shall the Licensee be made responsible for information being lost, deleted or wrongly sent as part of the 
    provided services.</p>

    <p>The Licensee is not liable for the possible misuse of content or personal information.</p>

    <p>The Licensee strives to ensure the constant smooth running of Open Broadcast. However, it neither guarantees uninterrupted 
    service or availability of Open Broadcast, nor is it liable for technically caused transmission delays or downtime. 
    For instance, temporary disruption can be caused by technical faults or necessary maintenance work.</p>

    <p>The Licensee is not liable for the unwarranted access to personal user information by third parties (e.g. unwarranted 
    access by &quot;hackers&quot; to the database). Neither shall the Licensee be liable for the misuse by third parties of details 
    and information made accessible to these third parties by Users themselves.</p>

    <p>The Licensee is entitled at any time to cede the provision of the services by Open Broadcast wholly or partly to third 
    parties or to close down those services with or without the indication of reasons.</p>

    <h2 id="en_7">7 Measures by the Licensee</h2>

    infringing User and the saved data pertaining to the account.</p>


    <h2 id="en_8">8 Final Clause</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Severability Clause</h3>

    <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall become or be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity of 
    the remaining provisions shall not in any way be impaired thereby. The invalid provision shall be replaced with a legally 
    effective provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. The same applies 
    to contractual omissions.</p>

    <h3>8.2 Applicable Law and Place of Jurisdiction</h3>

    <p>Swiss jurisdiction is applicable. The Place of Jurisdiction is the registered office of the Licensee insofar as it is 
    legally permitted.</p>
