# Ralplan (Consensus Planning Alias)

Ralplan is a shorthand alias for `$plan --consensus`. It drives Planner, Architect, and Critic planning and records their review lifecycle with **RALPLAN-DR structured deliberation** (short mode by default, deliberate mode for high-risk work). That local lifecycle never authorizes an execution handoff: an official host-issued receipt verified through a documented non-user-mintable host surface is required. Scholastic is an advisory native agent/persona for ontology-heavy planning evidence, not part of the lifecycle.

## Usage

```
$ralplan "task description"
```

## Flags

- `--interactive`: Enables user prompts at key decision points (draft review in step 2 and final approval in step 6). Without this flag the workflow runs fully automated — Planner → Architect → Critic loop — and outputs the final plan without asking for confirmation.
- `--deliberate`: Forces deliberate mode for high-risk work. Adds pre-mortem (3 scenarios) and expanded test planning (unit/integration/e2e/observability). Without this flag, deliberate mode can still auto-enable when the request explicitly signals high risk (auth/security, migrations, destructive changes, production incidents, compliance/PII, public API breakage).

## Ontology-heavy review

For requirements semantics, taxonomy, prompt/spec design, policy distinctions, or category-risk architecture, subagent `Scholastic` may be cited as an available advisory ontology reviewer/persona. Its findings can inform the plan or follow-up evidence when explicitly used, but `$ralplan` itself records Architect→Critic lifecycle evidence only; neither those reviews nor Scholastic evidence is a durable execution authorization.

## Usage with interactive mode

```
$ralplan --interactive "task description"
```

## Behavior

## GPT-5.6 Guidance Alignment

Use the shared workflow guidance pattern: outcome-first framing, concise visible updates for multi-step planning, local overrides for the active workflow branch, evidence-backed planning and validation expectations, explicit stop rules, right-sized implementation/PRD shape, and automatic continuation for safe reversible steps. Ask only for material, destructive, credentialed, external-production, or preference-dependent branches.

This skill invokes the Plan skill in consensus mode:

```
$plan --consensus <arguments>
$plan --consensus --interactive <arguments>
```

The consensus workflow:
1. **Planner** creates an adaptive plan (right-sized to task scope; do not default to exactly five steps) and a compact **RALPLAN-DR summary** before review. Current `[main]` vs `[planner]` behavior: standalone `$ralplan` may be authored by the active main planning lane unless the caller/runtime supplies a dedicated planner routing record; inside `$autopilot`, state field `planning_routing.owner:"planner"` means the initial Planner draft/decomposition must use dedicated `[planner]`. Set `.omx-config.json` `agentModels.planner` to opt into a specific planner model and force dedicated planner ownership for complex Autopilot planning even when `[main]` is not cheap/mini. The RALPLAN-DR summary includes:
   - Principles (3-5)
   - Decision Drivers (top 3)
   - Viable Options (>=2) with bounded pros/cons
   - If only one viable option remains, explicit invalidation rationale for alternatives
   - Deliberate mode only: pre-mortem (3 scenarios) + expanded test plan (unit/integration/e2e/observability)
2. **User feedback** *(--interactive only)*: If `--interactive` is set, use the structured question UI (`omx question` in attached tmux; native structured input outside tmux when available) to present the draft plan **plus the Principles / Drivers / Options summary** before review (Proceed to review / Request changes / Skip review). Otherwise, automatically proceed to review.
**Native role-routing preflight:** Keyword routing may already have selected Ralplan, but it is not authority. Run `omx ralplan preflight --json` only when the native task surface reports `role_routing_unavailable` and this workflow attempts adapted Ralplan Planner, Architect, or Critic authority, adapted role-intent, or adapted consensus authority. On `unsupported_documented_leader_proof`, stop before that adapted authority and use a Codex surface with documented root proof or a reviewed alternative workflow. Do not infer root identity from `session_id`, undocumented `thread_id`, session/pointer/transcript/cwd state, absence of child data, or a prompt label. Ordinary native planning, lifecycle, state, status, health, HUD, runtime, setup, install, sync, and unrelated delegation are outside this preflight boundary and remain governed by existing controls.

**Native role-routing rule:** When the native surface exposes `agent_type` role routing, set `agent_type` to an installed OMX role and never omit it for OMX work. When it does not (`role_routing_unavailable`), do not fabricate `agent_type`. On the exact reviewed Codex releases 0.144.5, 0.145.0, 0.146.1, and 0.148.0-alpha.5, adapted Ralplan Planner, Architect, Critic, role-intent, and consensus authority are unavailable because they lack documented root proof; every other version remains unknown and fails closed. Do not silently weaken routing with a prompt role label or inferred carrier. Use a Codex surface with documented root proof or a reviewed alternative workflow for that authority. A direct `omx ralplan role-intent write` attempt is denied with machine reason `unsupported_documented_leader_proof`.

3. **Architect** reviews for architectural soundness and must provide the strongest steelman antithesis, at least one real tradeoff tension, and (when possible) synthesis — **await completion before step 4**. Launch this as a subsequent role-specific `Architect` subagent and pass the full task statement, context snapshot, PRD/test-spec paths, and relevant prior findings; do not substitute an unvalidated reviewer identity or a short improvised reviewer prompt. In deliberate mode, Architect should explicitly flag principle violations.
4. **Critic** evaluates against quality criteria — run only after step 3 completes. Launch this as a subsequent role-specific `Critic` subagent with the full task statement, context snapshot, PRD/test-spec paths, and the completed Architect review; do not ask the Architect subagent to perform the Critic gate and do not substitute an unvalidated reviewer identity or a short improvised reviewer prompt. Critic must enforce principle-option consistency, fair alternatives, risk mitigation clarity, testable acceptance criteria, and concrete verification steps. In deliberate mode, Critic must reject missing/weak pre-mortem or expanded test plan.
5. **Re-review loop** (max 5 iterations): Any non-`APPROVE` Critic verdict (`ITERATE` or `REJECT`) MUST run the same full closed loop:
   a. Collect Architect and Critic feedback
   b. Revise the plan with Planner
   c. Return to Architect review
   d. Return to Critic evaluation
   e. Repeat this loop until Critic returns `APPROVE` or 5 iterations are reached
   f. If 5 iterations are reached without `APPROVE`, present the best version to the user
6. On Critic approval *(--interactive only)*: present the plan for review, change requests, rejection, or selection of a **requested future execution lane**. A local Critic approval is lifecycle-only and must not offer or begin an execution handoff while the host receipt verifier is unavailable.
7. *(--interactive only)* Record the user's planning disposition and any requested future execution lane; do not invoke `$ultragoal`, `$team`, `$ralph`, or another implementation lane without a verified official host receipt.
8. On local Architect→Critic approval, preserve the plan and reviews with `ralplan_consensus_gate.complete:false` and `blocked_reason:"documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable"`. Report the host blocker and stop rather than implementing directly.

> **Important:** Steps 3 and 4 MUST run sequentially as role-specific subagents. Do NOT issue both agent calls in the same parallel batch. Always await the subsequent `Architect` result before invoking the subsequent `Critic`; their completed approvals establish local lifecycle evidence only and cannot satisfy the durable execution gate.

## Planning/Execution Boundary

`$ralplan` is a planning mode. While ralplan is active and no explicit execution handoff is active, implementation-focused write tools are out of scope. Ralplan may inspect the repository and may write only planning artifacts such as `.omx/context/`, `.omx/plans/`, `.omx/specs/`, and required `.omx/state/` records.

The canonical flow is:

```
$ralplan -> local Architect→Critic lifecycle evidence -> verified official host receipt -> explicit execution lane -> $ultragoal | $team | $ralph
```

Before any execution lane begins, ralplan must emit terminal planning state (complete, paused, failed, or waiting for input) and the durable handoff record below. Do not continue from consensus planning into direct code edits in the same ralplan session.

## Durable Consensus Handoff Contract

Ralplan is not complete, skippable, or ready for execution merely because `.omx/plans/prd-*.md` and `.omx/plans/test-spec-*.md` exist. Those files are planning artifacts, not consensus evidence.

Before any Autopilot, Pipeline, Ultragoal, Team, Ralph, or implementation handoff, persist a durable handoff record that distinguishes:

- `planning_artifacts`: PRD/test-spec paths.
- `ralplan_architect_review`: the completed Architect review with an approving verdict.
- `ralplan_critic_review`: the completed Critic review with an approving verdict, recorded only after the Architect review.
- `ralplan_consensus_gate.complete:true` only after an official host-issued receipt is verified through a documented non-user-mintable host surface. Architect/Critic reviews, trackers, artifacts, and local receipt-shaped fields remain lifecycle or trace evidence only; until the verifier exists, persist `complete:false` with `blocked_reason:"documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable"`.

If Architect is missing/blocked, keep the workflow in Architect review or report that blocker. If Critic is missing/blocked/non-approving, keep the workflow in Critic/re-review or report the max-iteration outcome. Even after both reviews approve, they complete only the local review lifecycle; do not start execution until an official host receipt verifier authorizes the transition. Existing plan/test-spec files and local review artifacts are never permission to skip ralplan or execute.

Follow the Plan skill's full documentation for consensus mode details.

## Goal-Mode Follow-up Suggestions

When a verified official host receipt permits an execution handoff, include product-facing goal-mode suggestions alongside the existing Ralph and team options. Until then, record any requested lane as non-executing planning guidance and keep `ralplan_consensus_gate.complete:false` with `blocked_reason:"documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable"`.

- `$ultragoal` — **default goal-mode follow-up** for implementation or general goal-oriented follow-up plans that should become durable Codex/OMX goals with sequential completion tracking.
- `$autoresearch-goal` — research-project follow-up when the plan centers on a question, literature/reference gathering, evaluator-backed research, or a professor/critic-style research deliverable.
- `$performance-goal` — optimization/performance follow-up when the plan centers on speed, latency, throughput, memory, benchmark, or other measurable performance work.

Keep `$team` as a first-class execution option and keep `$ralph` available only as an explicit fallback where appropriate: use Ultragoal as the default durable goal-mode follow-up, Team for coordinated parallel implementation, and Ralph only for intentionally selected persistent single-owner completion/verification pressure. For parallelizable durable-goal delivery, recommend `$ultragoal` + `$team` together: Ultragoal remains the leader-owned `.omx/ultragoal` ledger/Codex-goal wrapper while Team runs parallel lanes and returns checkpoint-ready evidence. Do not present Ralph as the recommended follow-up when durable goal tracking is needed; present Ultragoal as the superseding default, with Team for parallel delivery and Ralph only as an explicit fallback when its narrow persistence loop is specifically desired.
Use the available-agent-types roster to produce explicit role/staffing allocation, reasoning-by-lane guidance, concrete launch hints (including `omx team` when parallel delivery is justified), and team verification responsibilities for any future receipt-authorized execution path.

## Pre-context Intake

Before consensus planning or execution handoff, ensure a grounded context snapshot exists:

1. Derive a task slug from the request.
2. Reuse the latest relevant snapshot in `.omx/context/{slug}-*.md` when available.
3. If none exists, create `.omx/context/{slug}-{timestamp}.md` (UTC `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`) with:
   - task statement
   - desired outcome
   - known facts/evidence
   - constraints
   - unknowns/open questions
   - likely codebase touchpoints
4. If ambiguity remains high, gather brownfield facts first. `omx explore` is deprecated; use normal repository inspection tools/subagents for simple read-only repository lookups and `omx sparkshell` only for explicit shell-native read-only evidence. Then run `$deep-interview --quick <task>` before continuing.
5. If the plan depends on official docs, version-aware framework guidance, best practices, or external dependency behavior, use `$best-practice-research` as the bounded evidence wrapper and auto-delegate `researcher` for the official/upstream lookup before finalizing the planning handoff so execution does not start from repo-local recall alone.
6. If a prior `$autoresearch` or `$autoresearch-goal` run exists, treat its approved artifact as evidence for the plan. Do not include Autoresearch as a final architecture or runtime component unless the user explicitly requested ongoing research automation; otherwise synthesize the evidence into the `$ralplan` ADR, risks, and verification steps.

Do not hand off to execution modes until this intake is complete; if urgency forces progress, explicitly document the risk tradeoffs.

## Pre-Execution Gate

### Why the Gate Exists

Execution modes (ralph, autopilot, team, ultrawork) spin up heavy multi-agent orchestration. When launched on a vague request like "ralph improve the app", agents have no clear target — they waste cycles on scope discovery that should happen during planning, often delivering partial or misaligned work that requires rework.

The ralplan-first gate intercepts underspecified execution requests and redirects them through the ralplan consensus planning workflow. This ensures:
- **Explicit scope**: A PRD defines exactly what will be built
- **Test specification**: Acceptance criteria are testable before code is written
- **Consensus**: Planner, Architect, and Critic agree on the approach
- **No wasted execution**: Agents start with a clear, bounded task

### Good vs Bad Prompts

**Passes the gate** (specific enough for direct execution):
- `ralph fix the null check in src/hooks/bridge.ts:326`
- `autopilot implement issue #42`
- `team add validation to function processKeywordDetector`
- `ralph do:\n1. Add input validation\n2. Write tests\n3. Update README`
- `ultrawork add the user model in src/models/user.ts`

**Gated — redirected to ralplan** (needs scoping first):
- `ralph fix this`
- `autopilot build the app`
- `team improve performance`
- `ralph add authentication`
- `ultrawork make it better`

**Bypass the gate** (when you know what you want):
- `force: ralph refactor the auth module`
- `! autopilot optimize everything`

### When the Gate Does NOT Trigger

The gate auto-passes when it detects **any** concrete signal. You do not need all of them — one is enough:

| Signal Type | Example prompt | Why it passes |
|---|---|---|
| File path | `ralph fix src/hooks/bridge.ts` | References a specific file |
| Issue/PR number | `ralph implement #42` | Has a concrete work item |
| camelCase symbol | `ralph fix processKeywordDetector` | Names a specific function |
| PascalCase symbol | `ralph update UserModel` | Names a specific class |
| snake_case symbol | `team fix user_model` | Names a specific identifier |
| Test runner | `ralph npm test && fix failures` | Has an explicit test target |
| Numbered steps | `ralph do:\n1. Add X\n2. Test Y` | Structured deliverables |
| Acceptance criteria | `ralph add login - acceptance criteria: ...` | Explicit success definition |
| Error reference | `ralph fix TypeError in auth` | Specific error to address |
| Code block | `ralph add: \`\`\`ts ... \`\`\`` | Concrete code provided |
| Escape prefix | `force: ralph do it` or `! ralph do it` | Explicit user override |

### End-to-End Flow Example

1. User types: `ralph add user authentication`
2. Gate detects: execution keyword (`ralph`) + underspecified prompt (no files, functions, or test spec)
3. Gate redirects to **ralplan** with message explaining the redirect
4. Ralplan consensus runs:
   - **Planner** creates initial plan (which files, what auth method, what tests)
   - **Architect** reviews for soundness
   - **Critic** validates quality and testability
5. Architect and Critic approval completes the local planning lifecycle only. Persist `ralplan_consensus_gate.complete:false` with `blocked_reason:"documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable"` and report the host blocker.
6. Execution does not begin until a verified official host receipt authorizes the selected handoff path.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Gate fires on a well-specified prompt | Add a file reference, function name, or issue number to anchor the request |
| Want to bypass the gate | Prefix with `force:` or `!` (e.g., `force: ralph fix it`) |
| Gate does not fire on a vague prompt | The gate only catches prompts with <=15 effective words and no concrete anchors; add more detail or use `$ralplan` explicitly |
| Redirected to ralplan but want to skip planning | In the ralplan workflow, say "just do it" or "skip planning" to transition directly to execution |

## Scenario Examples

**Good:** The user says `continue` after the workflow already has a clear next step. Continue the current branch of work instead of restarting or re-asking the same question.

**Good:** The user changes only the output shape or downstream delivery step (for example `make a PR`). Preserve earlier non-conflicting workflow constraints and apply the update locally.

**Bad:** The user says `continue`, and the workflow restarts discovery or stops before the missing verification/evidence is gathered.
